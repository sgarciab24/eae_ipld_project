    "# Project 2: Netflix Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be working with a dataset of Netflix titles. We will be using its data to answer some questions about Netflix titles, directors, and countries using Pandas. We will also use Matplotlib to do a couple of interesting visualizations to get more interesting insights. The data is stored in a csv file named `netflix_titles.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data extracted from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows (with some cleaning and modifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.1.` Load the data using Pandas read_csv, use `show_id` as the index_col parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.2.` What is the min and max release years?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.3.` How many director names are missing values (NaN)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.4.` How many different countries are there in the data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.5.` How many characters long are on average the title names? (create a new column with the titles length if needed)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.6.` For a given year, make a pie chart of the number of movies and series combined made by every country, limit it to the top 10 countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2.7.` Make a line chart of the average duration of movies (not TV shows) in minutes for every year across all the years. (hint: you can create a new column with the integer value of the minutes and then use groupby year and then average on that minutes column)"
